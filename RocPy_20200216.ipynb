        "# Workflow with PyCaret and Streamlit\n",
        "\n",
        "PyCaret may be \"low-code\" or \"lower-code\" :) but its depth and breadth of features requires \"more-thinking\"! Yes - it is easy to set it in default mode, but I want to use it to supplement my learning. I find it surfaces gaps in theory and practice quicker (which is in-line with my learning goals) and forces me to be clearer about the choices and options that I select. I spend less time in copy-paste and can invest it in analyzing and evaluating.\n",
        "\n",
        "One concern is the footprint of the PyCaret 2.X library and its growth as new features and capabilities are added to it. I had issues deploying a Streamlit app serving a PyCaret-build ML model on a free-tier Heroku dyno as it exceeded the 500MB slug size (it came in at 574MB). I haven't done enough research to understand what is contributing to the size. Several bloggers were successfully able to deploy PyCaret 1.X models to the Heroku free tier dynos earlier in 2020.\n",
        "\n",
        "Models won't be deployed in an IDE or Jupyter Notebooks - they tend to be situated in containers and web apps. Streamlit helps us place the model in an environment closer to its usage context without requiring the app builder to be fluent in front-end and back-end components and technologies. Yes, eventually a productionized solution will require people fluent in building secure, performant web applications - but it enables us to independently showcase our work. It forces us to think about the user experience using \"business language\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Ease of deployment and integration with github for deployment of changes are great selling points for Streamlit Sharing. Pricing for the service is not known at this point, currently it is providing a showcase for Data Science and Machine Learning capabilities and possibilities similar to what Tableau Public has provided for Visual Analytics."
